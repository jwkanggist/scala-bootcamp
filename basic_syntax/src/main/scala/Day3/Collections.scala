/*

1	 Scala Lists
Scala's List[T] is a linked list of type T.

2	 Scala Sets
A set is a collection of pairwise different elements of the same type.

3	 Scala Maps
A Map is a collection of key/value pairs. Any value can be retrieved based on its key.

4	Scala Tuples
Unlike an array or list, a tuple can hold objects with different types.

5	Scala Options
Option[T] provides a container for zero or one element of a given type.

6	Scala Iterators
An iterator is not a collection, but rather a way to access the elements of a collection one by one.
